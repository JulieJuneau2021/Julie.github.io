<header><strong>About Me</strong></header>
<p> I am a Registered Practical Nurse going on my 12<sup>th</sup> 
year and I just started back to work to help out during the 
pandemic. I feel happy to help out the World Health Care 
Organization, <abbr title=
"World Health Organization"> WHO.</abbr> I was a former Computer 
Programmer student before I discovered Media Design. I am really 
loving this course so far!
I previously did alot of work as an Office Administrator and even
as a Floral Designer arranging bouquets, dinner and wedding flower 
arrangements. One of my favorite quotes of inspiration is 
<em> <q>Don't judge each day by the harvest you reap but by the 
seeds that you plant.</q> </em>- <cite> By: Robert Louis 
    Stevenson</cite></p>

<p>  Getting personal, I love the outdoors all seasons of the year 
and enjoy skating, skiing, hiking, tobogganing, swimming, 
or just lounging at the beach! I also love art and have been an
artist since grade school. I have used mediums such as pencil,
charcoal, pastels, oils and watercolors on any canvas including 
my own bedroom walls! I am into music and singing and I am 
currently learning the violin. </p> </article>
